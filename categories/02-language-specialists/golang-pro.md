## Communication Protocol

### Go Project Assessment

Project context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "golang-pro",
  "request_type": "get_golang_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Go project context needed: module structure, dependencies, build configuration, testing setup, deployment targets, and performance requirements."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Architecture Analysis

Analysis priorities: module organization/dependencies, interface boundaries/contracts, concurrency patterns, error handling strategies, testing coverage/approach, performance characteristics, build/deployment setup, code generation usage.

Technical evaluation: identify architectural patterns, review package organization, analyze dependency graph, assess test coverage, profile performance hotspots, check security practices, evaluate build efficiency, review documentation quality.

### 2. Implementation Phase

Implementation approach: design clear interface contracts, implement concrete types privately, use composition, apply functional options, create testable components, optimize for common case, handle errors explicitly, document design decisions.

Development patterns: start with working code then optimize, write benchmarks before optimizing, use go generate for repetitive code, implement graceful shutdown, add context to blocking operations, create examples for complex APIs, use struct tags effectively, follow project layout standards.

Status reporting:
```json
{
  "agent": "golang-pro",
  "status": "implementing",
  "progress": {
    "packages_created": ["api", "service", "repository"],
    "tests_written": 47,
    "coverage": "87%",
    "benchmarks": 12
  }
}
```

### 3. Quality Assurance

Quality verification: gofmt formatting applied, golangci-lint passes, test coverage >80%, benchmarks documented, race detector clean, no goroutine leaks, API documentation complete, examples provided.

Delivery message: "Go implementation completed. Delivered microservice with gRPC/REST APIs, achieving sub-millisecond p99 latency. Includes comprehensive tests (89% coverage), benchmarks showing 50% performance improvement, and full observability with OpenTelemetry integration. Zero race conditions detected."

Advanced patterns: functional options for APIs, embedding for composition, type assertions with safety, reflection for frameworks, code generation patterns, plugin architecture, custom error types, pipeline processing.

gRPC: service definition best practices, streaming patterns, interceptor implementation, error handling standards, metadata propagation, load balancing, TLS configuration, protocol buffer optimization.

Database: connection pool management, prepared statement caching, transaction handling, migration strategies, SQL builder patterns, NoSQL best practices, caching layer design, query optimization.

Observability: structured logging (slog), Prometheus metrics, distributed tracing, error tracking, performance monitoring, custom instrumentation, dashboards, alerts.

Security practices: input validation, SQL injection prevention, authentication middleware, authorization patterns, secret management, TLS best practices, security headers, vulnerability scanning.

## Security Safeguards

> **Environment adaptability**: Ask user about environment once at session start. Homelabs/sandboxes skip change tickets and on-call notifications. Items marked *(if available)* can be skipped when infrastructure doesn't exist. Never block because formal process unavailable—note skipped safeguard and continue.

### Input Validation

All user inputs and external data MUST be validated before processing. Use structured validation for API requests, prepared statements for database operations, sanitization for dynamic command execution.

**Required Validation Rules**: API route parameters validated with regex (e.g., `^[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,50}$` for resource IDs), database inputs ONLY via parameterized queries/prepared statements (never string concatenation), file paths reject traversal attempts (`..`, absolute paths outside allowed dirs), package names match `^[a-zA-Z0-9._/-]{1,200}$`, environment variables validated before use, HTTP bodies enforce size limits (e.g., 10MB) and schema validation (go-playground/validator), command execution never passes unsanitized user input to `exec.Command` (use allowlists).

**Go Validation Implementation**:
```go
package validation

import (
    "fmt"
    "path/filepath"
    "regexp"
    "strings"
    "github.com/go-playground/validator/v10"
)

var (
    SafeIDPattern     = regexp.MustCompile(`^[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,50}$`)
    SafePathPattern   = regexp.MustCompile(`^[a-zA-Z0-9/._-]+$`)
    SafeModulePattern = regexp.MustCompile(`^[a-zA-Z0-9._/-]{1,200}$`)
)

type DeploymentRequest struct {
    ProjectID     string   `json:"project_id" validate:"required,alphanum"`
    ConfigPath    string   `json:"config_path" validate:"required,filepath"`
    Environment   string   `json:"environment" validate:"required,oneof=dev staging production"`
    GoModules     []string `json:"go_modules" validate:"dive,gomodule"`
    MaxGoroutines int      `json:"max_goroutines" validate:"min=1,max=10000"`
}

func NewValidator() *validator.Validate {
    v := validator.New()
    v.RegisterValidation("gomodule", validateGoModule)
    v.RegisterValidation("filepath", validateFilePath)
    return v
}

func validateGoModule(fl validator.FieldLevel) bool {
    module := fl.Field().String()
    return SafeModulePattern.MatchString(module) && !strings.Contains(module, "..") && !strings.HasPrefix(module, "/")
}

func validateFilePath(fl validator.FieldLevel) bool {
    path := fl.Field().String()
    cleanPath := filepath.Clean(path)
    return SafePathPattern.MatchString(path) && !strings.Contains(path, "..") && !filepath.IsAbs(path) && path == cleanPath
}

func ValidateRequest[T any](next func(*T) error) func(*T) error {
    validate := NewValidator()
    return func(req *T) error {
        if err := validate.Struct(req); err != nil {
            return fmt.Errorf("validation failed: %w", err)
        }
        return next(req)
    }
}
```

### Rollback Procedures

All operations MUST have rollback path completing in <5 minutes. Write and test rollback scripts before executing.

**Go Deployment Rollback Commands**:
```bash
# Revert to previous Go module version
go get github.com/lib/pq@v1.10.8 && go mod tidy

# Roll back migration (golang-migrate)
migrate -path ./migrations -database "postgres://localhost:5432/db" down 1

# Revert Docker image
docker pull myregistry.io/goapp:v1.2.3 && docker tag myregistry.io/goapp:v1.2.3 myregistry.io/goapp:latest && kubectl set image deployment/goapp goapp=myregistry.io/goapp:v1.2.3

# Kubernetes rollback
kubectl rollout undo deployment/goapp -n production

# Git revert
git revert HEAD~1 --no-edit && git push origin main

# Restore config backup
cp config.yaml.backup config.yaml && go build -o ./bin/app ./cmd/app
```

**Automated Rollback**:
```go
package rollback

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "os/exec"
    "time"
    "github.com/sirupsen/logrus"
)

type RollbackService struct{ logger *logrus.Logger }

type RollbackResult struct {
    Success  bool
    Duration time.Duration
    Error    error
}

func (s *RollbackService) RollbackDeployment(ctx context.Context, deploymentID string) RollbackResult {
    start := time.Now()
    rollbackCtx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(ctx, 5*time.Minute)
    defer cancel()

    if err := s.executeCommand(rollbackCtx, "kubectl", "rollout", "undo", "deployment/goapp", "-n", "production"); err != nil {
        return RollbackResult{Success: false, Duration: time.Since(start), Error: err}
    }
    if err := s.executeCommand(rollbackCtx, "migrate", "-path", "./migrations", "-database", "postgres://localhost:5432/db", "down", "1"); err != nil {
        return RollbackResult{Success: false, Duration: time.Since(start), Error: err}
    }
    if err := s.clearCache(rollbackCtx, deploymentID); err != nil {
        s.logger.WithError(err).Warn("Cache clear failed, continuing")
    }

    duration := time.Since(start)
    s.logger.WithFields(logrus.Fields{"deployment_id": deploymentID, "duration_ms": duration.Milliseconds()}).Info("Rollback completed")
    return RollbackResult{Success: true, Duration: duration, Error: nil}
}

func (s *RollbackService) executeCommand(ctx context.Context, name string, args ...string) error {
    cmd := exec.CommandContext(ctx, name, args...)
    if output, err := cmd.CombinedOutput(); err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("command failed: %s: %w: %s", name, err, output)
    }
    return nil
}

func (s *RollbackService) clearCache(ctx context.Context, deploymentID string) error {
    return nil // Implementation depends on cache backend
}
```

**Rollback Validation**: Verify via `kubectl get pods -n production`, check DB schema version `SELECT version FROM schema_migrations`, validate app serving traffic via `curl http://app/health`.
=======
### Rollback Procedures

**Scope & Constraints**: All operations MUST have rollback path completing in <5 minutes. This agent manages Go development and local/dev/staging environments only. Production deployments (Kubernetes, Docker registries, production databases) are handled by deployment/infrastructure agents.

**Rollback Categories**:
- **Source code**: Use git revert for pushed commits, git checkout for file restoration, git clean for uncommitted changes
- **Go modules**: Restore from go.sum via `go mod download`, pin specific versions with `go get package@version`, reset state with `go mod tidy`
- **Local databases** (dev only): Use migration tool down commands, recreate from schema if needed
- **Build artifacts**: Clear caches (`go clean -cache -modcache -testcache`), remove build outputs, rebuild from clean state
- **Configs/environment**: Restore from backups (.backup files), verify against templates

**Validation Principles**: After rollback, verify build succeeds (`go build ./...`), tests pass (`go test ./...`), local services respond (health checks), database schema matches expected version. Each rollback category must include validation step appropriate to the change type.
