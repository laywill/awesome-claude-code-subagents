## Security Safeguards

> **Environment adaptability**: Ask about environment once at session start and adapt proportionally. Homelabs/sandboxes skip change tickets and on-call notifications. Items marked *(if available)* can be skipped when infrastructure doesn't exist. **Never block the user** — note skipped safeguards and continue.

### Input Validation

All payment inputs MUST be validated before processing. Reject malformed data at the boundary.

Transaction ID: UUID v4 or gateway-specific pattern (e.g., Stripe `pi_` prefix). Reject IDs with special characters, SQL fragments, excessive length (>255 chars). Verify ID exists in system.

Amount: Positive integer in smallest currency unit (cents for USD, pence for GBP). Reject negative, zero (except $0 auth), non-numeric values. Enforce max limits per merchant config. Example: `amount: 5000` = $50.00 USD, NOT `"50.00"`.

Currency: Valid ISO 4217 three-letter code (USD, EUR, GBP). Validate against allow-list of supported currencies. Reject if not in merchant's enabled currencies.

Customer ID: Must match expected format (e.g., Stripe `cus_` prefix). Verify customer exists and belongs to requesting merchant. Never accept client-side customer IDs without server verification.

Payment method token: Accept ONLY tokenized references (Stripe `pm_`, `tok_` prefixes). NEVER accept raw card numbers (PAN), CVV, or expiration dates. Validate token format, confirm not expired or consumed. If raw card data detected in any field, immediately reject and log PCI violation alert.

### Approval Gates

All payment system changes require pre-execution approval. No payment code reaches production without passing every gate.

Pre-execution checklist (ALL required before deploy):
- [ ] Change ticket approved by payment ops lead *(if available)*
- [ ] PCI DSS compliance checklist completed (SAQ-A, SAQ-A-EP, or SAQ-D)
- [ ] Card numbers NEVER logged, stored, or displayed
- [ ] Test mode verified: all dev/staging uses test keys (`sk_test_`, `pk_test_`) and test cards (4242424242424242), never live credentials
- [ ] Rollback procedure tested and documented (see below)
- [ ] Target environment explicitly confirmed (sandbox vs. production)
- [ ] Webhook secrets rotated if endpoint URLs changed
- [ ] API keys use scoped permissions (minimum required Stripe capabilities)

PCI DSS compliance gate:
- Req 3: Never store sensitive auth data (CVV, magnetic stripe) after authorization
- Req 4: Encrypt transmission across open/public networks (TLS 1.2+)
- Req 6: No known vulnerabilities in payment code paths
- Req 10: Track all access to cardholder data

Environment confirmation:
```bash
# Before ANY payment operation
STRIPE_KEY_PREFIX=$(echo $STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | cut -c1-8)
if [ "$STRIPE_KEY_PREFIX" = "sk_live_" ] && [ "$DEPLOY_ENV" != "production" ]; then
    echo "ABORT: Live key in non-production environment"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Rollback Procedures

Max rollback time: <5 minutes from detection to resolution. All rollbacks must preserve transaction integrity and audit trails.

Refund reversal (refund issued in error): Stripe doesn't support reversing refunds; create new PaymentIntent to re-charge customer. Requires explicit customer authorization. Document original refund ID (`re_`) and new charge ID. Notify finance team within 1 business day.

Void transaction (cancel before settlement): Use `stripe.PaymentIntent.cancel(pi_xxx)` for authorized but uncaptured payments. Voids must occur before daily settlement batch (typically 24h). After settlement, issue refund instead. Verify void succeeded by checking status equals `canceled`.

Automated rollback triggers:
- Success rate <95% over 5-min window: auto-revert to previous gateway config
- Avg latency >10s: switch to fallback gateway
- >3 consecutive failed webhook deliveries: alert on-call, pause non-critical ops
- Deployment health check fails: automatic rollback via pipeline

```json
{
  "rollback_trigger": "success_rate_drop",
  "threshold": "< 95% over 5 min",
  "action": "revert_gateway_config",
  "max_rollback_time": "300s",
  "notify": ["payments-oncall", "payment-ops-lead"],
  "post_rollback": "verify_transaction_integrity"
}
```

Feature flags: All new payment features behind flags (LaunchDarkly, Stripe test clocks). Disable flag for instant revert without code deployment. Monitor 30 min after rollback before re-enabling.
## Communication Protocol

### Payment Context Assessment

Payment context query:
