# Task Plan: Repository Restructure (agents-restructure.md)

## Goal
Reorganise the repository from 11 categories (00-10) to 25 categories (00-24) with risk-tiered structure, moving/renaming ~117 existing agents, creating ~70 new agents, and updating all READMEs, plugin.json files, marketplace.json, and the root README.

## Reference Files
- **Source of truth**: `agents-restructure.md` (the new taxonomy)
- **Migration map**: `notes.md` (detailed old→new mapping)

## Phases

### Phase 3: Create new agent definitions
For each new agent, create a .md file following the existing pattern (YAML frontmatter with name, description with examples, tools, model; then body with role description, checklists, workflow).

**IMPORTANT:** Review AGENT_SECURITY_GUIDELINES.md before implementing to ensure correct security measures in place.

  - "Available Subagents" section with description per agent
  - Quick Selection Guide table
  - Common Combinations section
  - Getting Started section

### Phase 5: Create plugin.json files
- [ ] 5.1 Create `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` for each of the 25 categories with:
  - name (laywill-{shortname})
  - version: "3.0.0"
  - description
  - author, repository, license
  - agents array listing all .md files in the category

### Phase 6: Update marketplace.json
- [ ] 6.1 Rewrite `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` with all 25 plugins, updated source paths, keywords, and categories

### Phase 7: Update root README.md
- [ ] 7.1 Rewrite `README.md` with:
  - Updated subagent count badge (~179)
  - Risk Tiers at a Glance table
  - All 25 categories with agents listed under each
  - Updated plugin names in installation section

### Phase 8: Update CLAUDE.md
- [ ] 8.1 Update the "Repository Structure" section in CLAUDE.md to reflect new 00-24 categories

- [ ] 9.2 Remove old category directories
- [ ] 9.3 Verify all agents are reachable from README links
- [ ] 9.4 Remove `unreal-specialist.md` (merged into game-developer)

## Decisions Made
- `unreal-specialist` will be DROPPED (content merged into game-developer if relevant)
- Agents marked EXISTING but not in repo will be created as new (8 agents)
- Version bumped to 3.0.0 for this restructure
- Risk tier icons used in READMEs: ⚪ 🟢 🟡 🟠 🔴 ⛔

## Errors Encountered
- (none yet)

## Status
**Phases 1, 2, and 3 complete.** Ready to start Phase 4 (create category READMEs).
